# Global-Terrorism
## Global Terrorism Analysis - Tableau Project
## Overview
This project aims to provide an interactive analysis of global terrorism trends, patterns, and key statistics using data visualizations created in Tableau. The goal is to analyze terrorism incidents worldwide, identify hotspots, and explore trends in incidents, fatalities, and affected regions over time.

## Project Structure
This repository contains the Tableau Workbook and relevant resources used to build the interactive visualizations. The project leverages publicly available global terrorism data to visualize patterns, trends, and insights.

## Key Insights
Terrorism Hotspots: The most affected countries and regions by terrorist activities over time.
Trends Over Time: A visual representation of terrorist activities and how they have changed globally from year to year.
Attack Types: Breakdown of various attack methods (e.g., bombings, armed assaults) and their frequency.
Fatalities and Injuries: Correlation between the number of attacks and the level of casualties.

## Tableau Visualizations
Global Terrorism Overview: A global map showing terrorism incidents by country, including total fatalities and injuries.
Trends by Year: A time-series line graph visualizing the frequency of terrorist incidents over the years.
Attack Types: Bar charts comparing the different methods used in attacks (bombings, armed assaults, etc.).
Fatalities and Injuries: A scatter plot and heat map showing the correlation between the number of attacks and casualties.
